        <h1>How to Survive a Landslide</h1>
        <p>Landslides happen fast and can be dangerous, especially in areas with rain or shakes.
        Stay ready by keeping an eye on the weather and knowing your surroundings. Pack a simple emergency kit with basics like water and first aid.
        If there's a landslide warning, move to higher ground ASAP, avoiding valleys. Stay safe and be prepared!</p>

        <h2>How to Prepare for a Tsunami</h2>

        <p>Consider these steps before, during, and after a landslide:</p>

        <h3>Before a Landslide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid constructing structures in proximity to steep slopes, mountain edges, drainage ways, or natural erosion valleys.</li>
            <li>Obtain a thorough assessment of the ground conditions on your property.</li>
            <li>Observe the flow patterns of storm-water drainage near your residence, identifying convergence points that intensify runoff during storms. Steer clear of these areas during adverse weather conditions.</li>
            <li>Familiarize yourself with the emergency-response and evacuation strategies in place for your locality. Create a personalized emergency plan for your family or business.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>During a Landslide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay alert during a landslide threat, especially if you're in bed, as debris-flow incidents often happen when people are asleep.
                Use a Radio or battery-powered radio/TV for heavy rainfall warnings. Be cautious of intense, short bursts of rain, especially after prolonged wet weather.</li>
            <li>If in landslide-prone areas, consider leaving safely. Driving during heavy storms is risky; if at home, move to a second story if possible to avoid debris flow paths.</li>
            <li>Listen for unusual sounds like trees cracking or rocks colliding, as these may signal moving debris. Watch for small trickles of mud or debris, which can precede larger landslides.</li>
            <li>Drive carefully, as bridges may be compromised and culverts overflowed. Never cross flooded streams.
                Watch for collapsed pavement, mud, rocks, and signs of potential debris flows along roadsides.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>After a Landslide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay clear of the slide area to avoid the risk of additional slides.</li>
            <li>Tune in to local radio or TV stations for the latest emergency updates.</li>
            <li>Be vigilant for potential flooding, which may occur post-landslide or debris flow. Landslides and floods can be triggered by the same event.</li>
            <li>Refrain from entering the direct slide area, but check for injured and trapped individuals near the slide. Guide rescuers to their locations.</li>
            <li>Report any broken utility lines and damaged roads or railways to the relevant authorities promptly.
                 Swift reporting helps in shutting off utilities swiftly, preventing further hazards and injuries.</li>
        </ul>
